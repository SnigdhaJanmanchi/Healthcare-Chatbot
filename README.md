# Healthcare-Chatbot

This project implements an AI-driven customer support chatbot tailored for healthcare queries. It uses zero-shot intent classification combined with semantic similarity to respond to common user questions. The chatbot is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio.

## Project Overview

The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to queries about:

* Appointment scheduling
* Clinic operating hours
* Insurance-related inquiries
* Test results
* Prescription refills
* Telehealth availability
* General support and services

It classifies the user's intent and retrieves the most appropriate answer from a custom-built FAQ dataset, without requiring task-specific model training.
